# Twitter X Unfollow Tool

<img width="992" height="655" alt="twitter-unfollower-tool" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2671c935-df7d-4baa-9b89-d2efcb069337" />


A **completely offline** tool to find who doesn’t follow you back on Twitter X.

When you reach around 5K followers and following, it becomes quite difficult
to manually revisit and unfollow those who don’t follow back.
It’s time-consuming and error-prone, hence the need for this tool.

But unlike GitHub, Twitter X is strict about API usage, hence the need for this workaround.
The only downside is that changes are not reflected instantly, the actual
count of users not following back is based on the **archive** you’re using.
Requesting a new archive isn’t instant either, as Twitter X takes time to generate it.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Request Your Twitter Archive

1. Go to **Twitter → Settings**
2. Navigate to: **Your Account → Download an archive of your data**
3. Wait for Twitter to prepare it (typically 12–48 hours)
4. Download the ZIP file once it’s ready

---

### Step 2: Extract the Archive

Unzip the downloaded file and locate the following files:

```
data/follower.js
data/following.js
```

---

### Step 3: Run the Tool

#### **Option A: Local Use (Recommended)**

1. Download `unfollowers.html` from this repository
2. **Open Chrome where you’re logged into Twitter** *(important!)*
3. **Double-click** `unfollowers.html` or drag it into Chrome
4. Upload both `follower.js` and `following.js`
5. Click **Analyze**
6. Click usernames to open profiles — they’ll open in the same browser session
   (That’s why you must open it in the same Chrome profile where you’re logged in!)

---

### Step 4: View Results

You’ll see a list of accounts you follow who don’t follow you back, displayed as:

* **User IDs** (Twitter no longer includes handles in archives)
* **Clickable profile links**
* **Copy URL** buttons for convenience

> **Note:** Results show `User ID: 1234567890` instead of `@username` because Twitter archives only contain account IDs.
> The links still work perfectly!

> **Important:**
>
> * Twitter detects bulk unfollow actions. To stay safe,
>   unfollow slowly, around **25 users at a time**, then pause before continuing.
> * Opening **too many profile tabs** at once also counts as activity.
>   If pages stop loading or only show the **X icon**, it means you've
>   hit a temporary rate limit, wait a bit before continuing.
>   I noticed after opening the first 25 to unfollow, I will have this limit,
>   so I'll wait several minutes then just reload them, but I'm not closing the
>   entire Chrome.
> * We can also use the mobile app: simply load the tabs, say, still per 25,
>   then once we have the handle of each profile, search it in the mobile app.
>   This way, we do the actual unfollow in the mobile app, and we simply close
>   the 25 tabs and start a new batch, and we don't hit the Web page limit.
> * Since this tool uses **static archive data**, you might sometimes open
>   a profile that now follows you back. That's perfectly normal,
>   it just means the user started following you **after your archive was generated**.
